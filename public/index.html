  <h1>Michael Francis</h1>
  <h2>Software Developer</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a learner, a teacher, and a tinkerer. For me, writing software is
    about creativity and care, and experiencing the joys of learning and
    collaboration.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have skills in Rust, JavaScript, Python, Java, C, C++, Bash, Ruby, and
    C#.
  </p>

  <p>
    Linux is my wheelhouse. Check out my
    <a href="https://github.com/manfrancisco/knowledge-base">Knowledge Base</a>, where I document and share what I learn
    from my experiences tinkering.
    Have a look at my
    <a href="https://github.com/manfrancisco/.cfg">dotfiles</a>
    if you'd like to see how I configure my systems.
  </p>

  <p>I make heavy use of Git and Neovim in my workflow.</p>
